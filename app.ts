//Q:26 Alien Colors #2: Choose a color for an alien as you did in Exercise 25, and write an if-else chain.

//• If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just earned 5 points for 
// shooting the alien.

// • If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned 10 points.

// • Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that runs the else block.

let alienColour: string = "green";

if(alienColour === "green"){
console.log("ccongratulation! you earned 5 points shooting the alien");
}
else{
    console.log("ccongratulation! you earned 10 points shooting the alien");
}

// 2nd version
let alien_Colour: string = "red";

if(alien_Colour === "green"){
console.log("ccongratulation! you earned 5 points shooting the alien");
}
else{
    console.log("ccongratulation! you earned 10 points shooting the alien");
}
